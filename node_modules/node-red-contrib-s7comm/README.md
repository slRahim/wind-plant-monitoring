# node-red-contrib-s7comm

A Node-RED node to communicate with Siemens S7 PLCs.


## About
-----------
The Hilscher Node-RED *node-red-contrib-s7comm* node is designed to communicate with a SIMATIC S7-300/1200/1500 PLC of SIEMENS based on the RFC1006-communication protocol. The S7comm node can build up a connection with the SIMATIC-S7. Furthermore it can Read/Write Addresses of the PLC with specific S7-Datatype.

It is using the Open-Source Library nodeS7 as its Framework which is able to handle the communication with the PLC. Special thanks to plcpeople for creating nodes7.

## Install
-----------
Install the node directly from the management palette of Node-RED.

or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically: *%HOMEPATH%\.nodered* for Windows or  *~/.node-red* for Linux  ):

        npm install node-red-contrib-s7comm

or clone the repository within a specific folder in the Node-RED user directory and run the package.json:

        git clone https://github.com/Hilscher/node-red-contrib-s7comm

        cd node-red-contrib-s7comm

        npm install
