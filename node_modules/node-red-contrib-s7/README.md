# node-red-contrib-s7
A Node-RED node to interact with Siemens S7 PLCs.

This node was created as part of the [ST-One](https://st-one.io) project.


## Install

You can install this node directly from the "Manage Palette" menu in the Node-RED interface.

Alternatively, run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red` on Linux or `%HOMEPATH%\.nodered` on Windows

        npm install node-red-contrib-s7

NodeJS version 10 or greater and Node-RED version 1.0 or greater is required.


## Usage

Each connection to a PLC is represented by the **S7 Endpoint** configuration node. You can configure the PLC's Address, the variables available and their addresses, and the cycle time for reading the variables.

The **S7 In** node makes the variable's values available in a flow in three different modes:

*   **Single variable:** A single variable can be selected from the configured variables, and a message is sent every cycle, or only when it changes if _diff_ is checked. `msg.payload` contains the variable's value and `msg.topic` has the variable's name.
*   **All variables, one per message:** Like the _Single variable_ mode, but for all variables configured. If _diff_ is checked, a message is sent everytime any variable changes. If _diff_ is unchecked, one message is sent for every variable, in every cycle. Care must be taken about the number of messages per second in this mode.
*   **All variables:** In this mode, `msg.payload` contains an object with all configured variables and their values. If _diff_ is checked, a message is sent if at least one of the variables changes its value.


### Variable addressing

The variables and their addresses configured on the **S7 Endpoint** follow a slightly different scheme than used on Step 7 or TIA Portal. Here are some examples that may guide you on addressing your variables:

 - *) Note that strings on the PLC uses 2 extra bytes at start for size/length of the string
 - **) Note that javascript's `Date` are _always_ represented in UTC. Please use other nodes like [node-red-contrib-moment](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-moment) to properly handle type conversions


### Notes on S7-1200/1500

These newer PLCs offer an "extended" version of the S7 Protocol, while we have only a "basic" version of it.

Therefore, some additional configuration steps on the PLC are necessary:
 - "Optimized block access" must be disabled for the DBs we want to access ([image](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/snap7_client_file/db_1500.bmp))
 - In the "Protection" section of the CPU Properties, enable the "Permit access with PUT/GET" checkbox ([image](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/snap7_client_file/cpu_1500.bmp))


### Notes on Logo! 8

On the newest Logo! 8.FS4 (and possibly 0BA8) Logic modules there is no need to set the Mode to TSAP any more, instead the default Rack/Slot value of 0/2 works just fine.

The following table shows memory areas accessible without additional settings in the controller program:

*Note: These memory areas seem to be read-only from outside the controller, as they are directly used by the function blocks listed in "Logo Block" of the table*

| Logo Block | Logo VM Range | example Node-RED address                          | Description |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `I`        | `1024 - 1031` | `DB1,BYTE1024` or `DB1,X1024.5` or `DB1,WORD1024` | Reads input terminals 1...8 or 6 or 1...16 |
| `AI`       | `1032 - 1063` | `DB1,WORD1032`                                    | Reads analog input terminal 1. Always word sized. |
| `Q`        | `1064 - 1071` | `DB1,BYTE1064` or `DB1,X1064.5` or `DB1,WORD1064` | Reads output terminals 1...8 or 6 or 1...16 |
| `AQ`       | `1072 - 1103` | `DB1,WORD1072`                                    | Reads analog output terminal 1. Always word sized. |
| `M`        | `1104 - 1117` | `DB1,BYTE1104` or `DB1,X1104.5` or `DB1,WORD1104` | Reads bit flags M1...M8 or M6 or M1...16 |
| `AM`       | `1118 - 1245` | `DB1,WORD1118`                                    | Reads analog flag 1. Always word sized. |
| `NI`       | `1246 - 1061` | `DB1,BYTE1246` or `DB1,X1246.5` or `DB1,WORD1246` | Reads network input 1...8 or 6 or 1...16 |
| `NAI`      | `1262 - 1389` | `DB1,WORD1262`                                    | Reads analog network input 1. Always word sized. |
| `NQ`       | `1390 - 1405` | `DB1,BYTE1390` or `DB1,X1390.5` or `DB1,WORD1390` | Reads network output 1...8 or 6 or 1...16 |
| `NAQ`      | `1406 - 1469` | `DB1,WORD1406`                                    | Reads network output 1. Always word sized. |

On the other hand, Logo memory areas VM 0-849 are mutable from outside the controller, but they need to be mapped into the Logo program. Without mapping, data written into these addresses will have no effect on program execution. Used VM addresses in the range mentioned above can be read/written from/into in the Logo program using the "Network" function blocks (in the function block setup use the *"Local variable memory (VM)"* option to map VMs to the function block).

Some addressing examples:

| Logo VM | Example Node-RED address | Description |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------|
| `0`     | `DB1,BYTE0`              | R/W access  |
| `1`     | `DB1,X1.3`               | R/W access Note: use booleans |
| `2..3`  | `DB1,WORD2`              | R/W access  |
| `4..7`  | `DB1,DWORD4`             | R/W access  |
